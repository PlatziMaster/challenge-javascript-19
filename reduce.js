[0,1,2,3,4].reduce(function(accumulator,currentValue){
  return accumulator + currentValue
})//10

//the reduce method allows to operate
//between the array's items.
//in these case, the accumulator begin in
//the index 0 and current value is nex index, 
// and sum them.
//it iterate in every index and sum every value.
